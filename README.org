#+TITLE: ElCity (Emacs Lisp City)

* Overview

ElCity is a small, turn-based city builder that runs entirely inside Emacs.
The UI is ASCII-based and optimized for terminal Emacs sessions.  The core
simulation is deterministic and pure, while the UI handles rendering and input.

This is an excercise in implementing the "functional core / imperative shell" architecture
in a moderately sized project that with a developed UI. Every tile type is defined through
a DSL, with a strong separation between state and effects. Most functions in the core are
either pure or pure-ish.

Benefits to this approach:
- easy to debug
- scalable in terms of code: reduced cognitive load on both people and LLMs
- easy UX/UI as state is always localized
- easy to extend (with some discipline)
- easy to autotest

* Requirements

- Emacs 30.1+

- Optional: Eask for dependency management

* Installation

Clone the repository and add it to your Emacs load path.  Example with
=use-package=:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package elcity
  :load-path "/path/to/elcity"
  :commands (elcity-start))
#+end_src

If you are not using =use-package=, add the directory to =load-path=
and require the entry point:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/elcity")
(require 'elcity)
(elcity-start)
#+end_src

* Quick Start

From the project root:

#+begin_src sh
make run
#+end_src

Or from Emacs: =M-x elcity-start=

* Game Logic

- The game is turn-based.  Press =n= to advance one turn.
- Funds increase each turn by: (Population / 2) + (Commercial level + Industrial level).
- City Hall is the source of road connectivity and is unique and non-demolishable.
- Roads are only connected if they trace through other roads to City Hall.
- Power plants provide a Manhattan-radius of 6 tiles.
- Zones grow by 1 level per turn if powered and road-adjacent.
- Zones decay by 1 level per turn if they lose power or road adjacency.
- Maximum zone level is 3.
- Residential (R) supplies Workers in a radius and dislikes Pollution.
- Industrial (I) supplies Goods and Pollution and requires Workers.
- Commercial (C) requires Workers and Goods.

* Controls

- =R= select Residential and place once
- =C= select Commercial and place once
- =I= select Industrial and place once
- =r= select Road and place once
- =p= select Power plant and place once
- =h= select City Hall and place once
- =SPC= or =RET= place selected tool at cursor
- =d= demolish at cursor
- =u= undo last action
- =n= advance one turn
- Arrow keys move the cursor
- =o= cycle overlays (goods, polution, connectivity, etc)

* Visual Demo

This is a simplified snapshot to show the general layout.

* Basic Configuration

- Start with a custom map by calling =elcity-start= with a list of row strings.
- Example call: ~(elcity-start '("H=R0" "...."))~
- Map tokens are defined in tile definitions.
- Canonical tokens include =..=, =~~=, ~==~, =PP=, =HH=, =R0=-=R3=, =C0=-=C3=, =I0=-=I3=.
- Short aliases are also accepted: =.=, =~=, ~=~, =P=, =H=, =R=, =C=, =I=.
- Default map rows live in =elcity-maps.el= (=elcity-map-default-rows=).
- Default map size is set by =elcity-core-map-width= and =elcity-core-map-height=.

* Development

- =make test= runs ERT tests.
- =make lint= runs package lint, checkdoc, and byte compilation.
- =make compile= byte-compiles non-test files.

* Project Layout

- =elcity.el= entry point that wires core and UI
- =elcity-core.el= pure simulation and state transitions
- =elcity-tiles.el= tile definitions and effect metadata
- =elcity-ui.el= UI shell and input handling
- =elcity-maps.el= map presets
- =test/= ERT tests
